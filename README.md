This project uses a [XIAO ESP32-C3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html) with an attached [6x10 RGB Matrix for XIAO](https://www.seeedstudio.com/6x10-RGB-MATRIX-for-XIAO-p-5771.html). The XIAO is programmed and controlled using ESPHome and uses a custom C header file to help draw blinkenlights on the LED matrix. The speed of the blinkenlights can be adjusted as well as displaying a custom value.
